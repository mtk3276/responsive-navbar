## Project Description
This project implements a responsive navigation bar built with React. The Navbar adapts to both mobile and web layouts, providing a toggleable menu for mobile views. The app uses React Router for navigation and Material UI for styling. It includes both unit and integration tests to ensure robustness and functionality across different screen sizes and user interactions.

## Features
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Menu toggle for mobile views
- Easy integration with React Router
- Unit and integration tests with Jest
